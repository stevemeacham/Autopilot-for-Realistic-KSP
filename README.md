# Autopilot for Realistic KSP
## Overview
This software automates spacecraft and aircraft in the [Kerbal Space Program (KSP)](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com), an award-winning multi-platform space flight/disaster simulator.
> ### **Status: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**
> **This is a Work In Progress.** This repository is still being populated and its contents are being polished for public use.  Use GitHub to watch for when it becomes ready.
## Requirements
These programs execute within a virtual machine provided by [kOS: Kerbal Operating System (kOS)](https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/) within the KSP simulation.  They are designed to be the most applicable and beneficial in a realism-enhanced environment consisting of not only KSP and kOS, but also the "hard-mode" [Realism Overhaul](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/wiki), the "career-mode" [Realistic Progression](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/wiki/Introduction-and-Overview), and the "masochistic-mode" [Principia](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/blob/master/README.md).
